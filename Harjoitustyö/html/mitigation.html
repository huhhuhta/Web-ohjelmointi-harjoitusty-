    <h2>Mitigation and Response to the Potential Impact</h2>
        <p>As the world closely monitors asteroid 2024 YR4, with its potential to impact Earth in
            2032, international space agencies and governments are preparing a series of mitigation
            and response strategies. These efforts are aimed at minimizing the potential risks and
            ensuring the safety of Earth's inhabitants.
        </p>

    <h2>Continuous Monitoring and Data Collection</h2>
        <p>NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and other international organizations are
            continuously tracking asteroid 2024 YR4's trajectory. Advanced telescopes, including the
            James Webb Space Telescope, play a critical role in providing accurate and up-to-date
            information on the asteroid's size, composition, and orbit. This ongoing data collection is
            essential for refining impact probability estimates and informing mitigation strategies.
        </p>

    <h2>Deflection Missions</h2>
    <img src="../media/DART.jpg" alt="A poster of NASA's DART mission" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>One of the most promising mitigation strategies involves deflecting the asteroid from its
            collision course with Earth. Several deflection techniques are being considered:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kinetic Impactors:</strong> A spacecraft could be launched to collide with the asteroid, altering its trajectory through the force of impact, similar to the DART mission by NASA that shortened the asteroid Dimorphos' orbit by 32 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Gravity Tractors:</strong> A spacecraft could fly alongside the asteroid, using its gravitational pull to slowly change the asteroid's path over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Nuclear Explosions:</strong> As a last resort, a nuclear device could be detonated near the asteroid to change its trajectory. This method would be used only if other options prove ineffective.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Emergency Preparedness and Public Safety</h2>
        <p>Governments and disaster response agencies are developing comprehensive emergency
            preparedness plans to respond to the potential impact. These plans include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Warning Systems:</strong>Advanced early warning systems will provide timely alerts to affected regions, allowing for rapid evacuation and safety measures.</li>
            <li><strong>Evacuation Plans:</strong>Detailed evacuation plans will be put in place for regions at risk of impact or tsunami. Public information campaigns will ensure that residents are aware of evacuation routes and procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>Coordination with International Agencies:</strong>Collaboration with international organizations will ensure a coordinated and effective response to the impact scenario.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Post-Impact Recovery</h2>
        <p>In the event of an impact, post-impact recovery efforts will focus on providing immediate
            assistance and rebuilding affected areas. Key components of post-impact recovery include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Search and Rescue Operations:</strong>Rapid deployment of search and rescue teams to assist those trapped or injured in the impact zone.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Assistance:</strong>Establishing field hospitals and providing medical care to those affected by the impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Rebuilding:</strong>Reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, including transportation networks, utilities, and housing.</li>
            <li><strong>Psychological Support:</strong>Providing psychological support and counseling to help individuals cope with the trauma of the impact.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While the probability of asteroid 2024 YR4 impacting Earth in 2032 remains low, it is
            essential to prepare for all possible scenarios. Through continuous monitoring, potential
            deflection missions, and comprehensive emergency preparedness plans, the global
            community is preparing to mitigate the risks, hopefully ensuring the safety and well-being of
            those living in the potential impact zone.
